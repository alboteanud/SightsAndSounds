As a result, many ethnic Hungarians were forced to assimilate Romanian culture. In remote parts of the region, however, many people still wear traditional Transylvanian dress and practise their own ceremonial rituals and customs. Music likewise retains stylistic features of Hungarian music. The example is a dance song performed by a solo vocalist. The melody is limited to a few notes while the rhythm is in a quick duple metre—both elements common to Hungarian folk songs."

Despite being given little or no government recognition (unlike the Bulgarian Female Choir), Romany wedding band music, or stambolovo, is a favourite of the people. It is played at weddings, funerals, birth rites, and street festivals. Wedding band music is rooted in the highly ornamented melodies played on the Turkish zurna, a double-reed wind instrument common in the Thracian region. In this example, played by Ivo Papasov and his Bulgarian Wedding Band, currently the most popular of these bands, the zurna has been replaced by a clarinet, and the improvisatory element of the sound has clearly been affected by American jazz. The asymmetric or uneven metres common to this music are derived from traditional dance rhythms found throughout Bulgaria. Kopanitsa performed by Ivo Papasov and his Bulgarian Wedding Band"

Ultimately, the tango evolved as a highly choreographed dance style in Argentina’s slums and brothels and became immersed in rich, violent poetry.

   "music_description": "Azerbaijani music and culture are an intermingling of Iranian (Persian) and Turkish influences. The music, therefore, shares the concept of modes (system of scales) and free improvisation found in Persian and Turkish classical music. Like its instrumental music, vocal music in Azerbaijan is expressive, highly ornamented, and based on complex rhythmic cycles. The preferred style of classical singing emphasizes powerful voice production which moves from chest voice to falsetto. This is similar to the classical vocal tradition found in Persian art music. This excerpt is from a vocal repertoire that dates back to the Ottoman Empire, and may have been a war march. The female vocalist is accompanied by a small ensemble that includes the tar (Iranian long-necked lute), kamânche (spiked fiddle), and daf (Turkish frame drum)."

The procession moves to the pulse of the song as children dance alongside, carrying candles and fresh eggs, which they smash against the walls of the house at the moment the bridegroom enters the front gate. The song is actually a series of poems sung in classic Arabic. It begins by praising Allah and ends by celebrating the occasion and welcoming the groom."

The instrument’s origins date to the Ch’in dynasty (221–206 BC). Traditionally, the cheng was played for personal and popular entertainment; today it is regarded as a classical instrument. This piece, “Kao Shan Liu Shui” (“High Mountain and Running Water”), is an ancient composition that imitates the sound of flowing water. Many traditional compositions such as this describe scenes from nature and were written to induce a meditative state for clear thinking."

The subdued tone of the instrument lends itself to contemplation, and the playing technique demands great concentration.

   "music_description": "The Faroes are renowned for a unique type of ballad singing that accompanies community group dancing. This practice, which dates to the European medieval era, has been preserved largely because of the geographic isolation of the Faeroe Islands, which lie in the North Atlantic between Iceland and Norway. As a result of centuries of Danish control and trade with other nations, however, various instruments and musical genres have been introduced to the islands, many of which have been incorporated into existing traditions. The contemporary group, Spælimenniner, often combines these varying influences, as in this example of an old Danish ballad text set to a traditional Faroese melody, with modern instrumentation."

Instrumental dance music experienced a revival of its own in the 1970s and 1980s, as young Danish musicians, influenced by similar developments among Celtic bands, experimented with unusual combinations of instruments and novel musical arrangements. The result is that Danish traditional music has been reinvigorated and is now used for dance and in concert performances.

Choral singing is the most popular musical style, but a great variety of instruments—played solo or in small ensembles—is used to accompany dances.

European art music had also a great influence on the German folk-music tradition, and particularly in the 19th century a number of popular genres emerged. German folk music is generally set in duple or triple time with quick tempos. Melodies are primarily in major keys with the notes of the major chord especially prominent.

This excerpt is from the finale of his Ninth Symphony, which he based on the poem “Ode to Joy”, written by the German poet and dramatist Friedrich von Schiller (1759–1805).

The genre, including styles such as thumri and ghazal, has had a great influence on the music of the enormously successful Indian film industry. Light-classical music in India is based loosely on the ragas (melodic frameworks for improvisation) used in the Indian classical music tradition, as well as on melodies derived from folk music. Both thumri and ghazal use poetical texts which the singer embellishes and emphasizes through ornamented vocal improvisations. The example is a love song in the thumri style called “Dil Leke Muijhe Badnaam Kiva”, performed by the well-known vocalist Shobha Gurtu.

After a war with Japan in 1669, the Ainu were driven from Honshu to Hokkaido, which they called Ezo. Their culture revolves around salt-water fishing and the hunting of deer and bear in the colder northern part of the island.

The nagaswaram is a conical double-reed oboe, usually played in pairs. It is accompanied by a double-headed barrel drum and a pair of hand cymbals, which mark the rhythmic cycle of the music."

The song celebrates the season when the fruit trees flower and then bear fruit. The melody moves in half-steps and is sung by Abilem Lum, the composer. The basic rhythm is played on bamboo stamping tubes by women who sing in chorus, alternating and overlapping with the melody. The Temiar way of life is intimately connected to their rainforest environment. Humans, animals, trees, insects, and mountains all possess spirits which can meet in the sacred space of dreams, trances, and ceremonies. Songs come to the singer in dreams and are then used in community ceremonies that feature singing and trance dancing. These ceremonies may mark changes in the seasons, provide a way of contacting other spirits, and heal illnesses."

It is rectangular with five to nine strings and comes in three sizes, roughly corresponding to the soprano, tenor, and bass pitch ranges."

Local traditional instruments such as a bamboo flute, a ka (large hand drum), a tibwa (two hardwood sticks used to mark rhythm), a boula (single-headed drum), and a gourd filled with pebbles are combined with electric guitars, synthesizers, a drum set, and brass instruments to create a “big” sound that can be heard in large crowds of revellers."

As in this example, each song details complex ideas about the nature of a particular winti (god or spirit of the earth, water, or sky) and marks a specific drum rhythm associated with it. During rituals, participants become possessed by a winti, develop aspects of its personality, and dance in its honour."
